## This is a readme generator which produces a professional template that we use in the CLI so that we can automate the need for writing a Readme all by itself.

## Installation
Make sure to go to the branch of README on Github.com/keurid and clone the files from ReadmeGenerator using Git Bash and when instructed type in git clone git@github.com:keurid/ReadmeGenerator.git. After you have done this, then you can run this code in VS code by opening the integrated terminal on the folder then typing in "node index".
